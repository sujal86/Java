# Procedure base Programs

->  Find string count
->  Find odd-even number from an array
->  Fibonacci series
->  Print Factorial to given terms.
->  Reverse a word
->  Reverse the sentence
->  Create a Program for any given number in STRING 
    and all of the mathematical functions can apply on it. 
    i.e. '2' + '3.5' should give output 5.5
->  SUM of digits program 
    i.e. 234 = 9
->  Grade Finding program.
    i.e. take input from user as marks and print which grade they have
->  Find Highest, 2nd highest, lowest and 2nd lowest digits from the given array
->  Print Matrix from given two different arrays.
->  Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication between two matrix
->  Reverse Alternative Character of String array 
    i.e. IMPORTANT -> MIOPTRNAT
->  Upgrade the Above program for Generic customisable reverse input number. 
    i.e.    Case1 : Input 2 IMPORTANT -> MIOPTRNAT 
            Case2 : Input 3 IMPORTANT -> PMITROTNA 
            Case3 : Input 4 IMPORTANT -> OPMINATRT

# Class Base Programs

->  Bank Application which contain user opening balance, deposit amount, withdraw amount, check balance methods.
->  Create a Transportation class and inherit in by Air, Road, Water 
    and also show the different ways to travel from those three different classes.
->  Create class for user profile and take various property 
    which include all different type of java datatype. 
    create static method too. 
    every object can take inputs to create CV. 
    apply needed validations and exceptions.
